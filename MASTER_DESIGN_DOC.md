# **AETHERIA: THE IDLE CHRONICLES**
## *Comprehensive Game Design Document*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Aetheria** is a cosmic fantasy idle RPG blending bright magical wonder with eldritch dark fantasy elements. Players progress through a single kingdom (Valdoria) while uncovering cosmic threats that bridge the material and astral planes. The game emphasizes **constant micro-goals**—ensuring players always have "one more thing" to achieve before logging off, whether that's a crafting queue finishing, a dungeon timer resetting, or a skill milestone unlocking new content.

**Core Loop:** Skill training → Resource gathering → Crafting/Combat → Exploration → Story unlocks → Repeat with new tools

## I. WORLD BIBLE: THE AETHERIAN COSMOS

### **The Dual Nature of Reality**

Aetheria exists in a state of cosmic tension. The **Luminar** (bright magical energy) flows from the Celestial Spires above, while the **Voidmire** (dark cosmic essence) seeps from cracks in reality. These forces aren't good vs. evil—they're necessary opposites, like breathing in and out.

**The Great Joke:** The universe was created when the Primordial Trickster, **Blibbertooth the Unserious**, sneezed during a formal divine ceremony. Creation was accidental, which explains why magic sometimes behaves unpredictably and why chickens exist. This comedic undertone permeates the world—serious cosmic stakes handled by absurd characters.

### **Valdoria: The Anchor Kingdom**

A peninsula kingdom roughly the size of Ireland, surrounded by the **Shimmering Sea** (which literally shimmers with latent magic). Valdoria contains:

- **The Crownlands:** Central hub, player home territory
- **The Whispering Woods:** Enchanted forest with sentient trees that gossip
- **The Scorched Reach:** Volcanic region where Voidmire pools
- **The Skyward Peaks:** Mountains touching the lower Celestial Spires
- **The Sunken Archives:** Underground ruins of previous civilizations
- **The Fey Markets:** Planar crossover point where otherworldly traders appear

**Cosmic Threat:** The **Unraveling**—patches of reality where the Luminar and Voidmire are out of balance, creating "Glitch Zones" where physics behave oddly (comedic opportunities: gravity reversing, NPCs speaking in palindromes, loot drops being literal drops of loot falling from sky).

### **Major Factions**

1. **The Order of the Balanced Scale:** Stoic knights maintaining cosmic equilibrium. Their Grandmaster is a sentient suit of armor with no body inside, who insists this is "perfectly normal."

2. **The Void-Touched Collective:** Not evil—just people who've embraced Voidmire energy. They throw excellent parties but speak in unsettling echoes. Led by **Lady Mirthless**, who actually has an excellent sense of humor but maintains brand consistency.

3. **The Celestial Bureaucracy:** Angels who are obsessed with paperwork. They grant divine blessings but require forms in triplicate. **Archangel File-Not-Found** is a major NPC.

4. **The Accidental Cult of Blibbertooth:** Religious group that treats cosmic absurdity as sacred. Their temples are comedy clubs. High Priest **Gigglesworth** offers quests involving practical jokes that accidentally save the world.

---

## II. CHARACTER SYSTEM

### **The Protagonist: The Anchor**

Players aren't a "chosen one"—they're an **Anchor**, someone whose soul is unusually heavy in the cosmic sense. This means:
- Immune to the Unraveling's chaotic effects
- Can harness both Luminar and Voidmire without exploding
- Tends to attract bizarre coincidences (narrative justification for RNG)

**Character Creation:**
- **Ancestry:** Human, Elf (time-dilated, speak slowly), Dwarf (cosmic miners), Fey-Touched (partially unreal), or Void-Blooded (slightly translucent)
- **Starting Affinity:** Luminar (defensive/support), Voidmire (offensive/debuff), or Balanced (flexible, slower progression)
- **Cosmic Quirk:** Random comedic trait (e.g., "Attracts sentient furniture," "Must speak in third person when nervous," "Hair changes color based on lies told nearby")

### **Companion System (Unlocks at Level 20)**

Hire **Wandering Souls**—NPCs with their own skill levels who can train skills while you're offline or accompany you in combat.

**Example Companions:**
- **Barnaby the Uncertain:** A warrior who deals 2x damage but has 50% chance to hit himself. Optimistic regardless.
- **Scholar Yvette:** Researcher who speeds up crafting but occasionally creates explosions (small resource refunds when this happens).
- **Sir Reginald Pomp:** Knight who automatically sells grey items but delivers long speeches about each one.

## IV. COMBAT SYSTEM: "THE ENCOUNTER"

### **Structure**

Combat occurs in **Instances**—pocket dimensions where time moves differently (justifies idle/offline combat).

**The Flow:**
1. **Scout:** Choose location (Wilderness, Dungeon, Raid, Cosmic Rift)
2. **Prepare:** Select loadout, companions, consumables
3. **Engage:** Choose Active or Auto mode
4. **Resolve:** Collect loot, manage inventory, decide next action

### **Active Combat Interface**

```
[Enemy: Void-Touched Bear (Lv. 45)]
[Health: ████████░░ 80%] [Status: Enraged (+20% dmg, -10% acc)]

[Your Status]
HP: 450/500 | MP: 80/100 | Stance: Balanced
Active Buffs: Iron Skin (2:30), Sharpened Blade (5:00)

[Action Bar]
[Basic Attack] [Heavy Strike (15 MP)] [Shield Bash (Stun)] 
[Item: Health Pot] [Item: Mana Pot] [Flee]

[Companion: Barnaby] "I'm feeling confident! (50% confidence buff)"
```

**Active Advantages:**
- Manual skill timing for combos (e.g., Shield Bash → Heavy Strike while stunned = +50% damage)
- Potion usage optimization
- Fleeing before death (saves 50% of potential loot)
- Special attack charging (hold for power, release for effect)

**Auto/Offline Combat:**
- Uses AI script based on your last 10 active fights (learns your preferences)
- Consumes potions automatically (set threshold in UI)
- 70% efficiency of active play (loot and XP)
- Death possible but rare (auto-flee at 20% HP unless disabled)

### **Enemy Factions (12 Major Types)**

1. **The Unraveled:** Reality-corrupted beings with glitchy animations and unpredictable attack patterns
2. **Celestial Constructs:** Angelic automatons testing your worth
3. **Void-Touched Wildlife:** Normal animals exposed to cosmic energy
4. **The Forgotten:** Undead from previous cycles of reality
5. **Fey Tricksters:** Mischievous otherworldly beings (combat + dialogue options)
6. **Cult of the Serious:** Enemies who hate Blibbertooth's chaos, ironically creating their own
7. **Astral Pirates:** Interdimensional looters with randomized loot tables
8. **Living Dungeons:** The dungeon itself is the enemy (environmental hazards)
9. **Time-Echoes:** Past versions of yourself or famous heroes
10. **The Bureaucracy's Rejected:** Failed angelic experiments
11. **Cosmic Vermin:** Eldritch cockroaches, reality-mites, void-rats (low level, swarms)
12. **Primordial Fragments:** Pieces of dead gods, world bosses

### **Dungeon System**

**Types:**
- **Delves:** 5-10 minute active experiences, 1-hour offline clear
- **Expeditions:** 30-minute active, 4-hour offline, multiple floors
- **Raids:** Weekly lockout, require specific gear scores, guild-supported (future)
- **The Infinite Stair:** Procedurally generated endless dungeon for leaderboard chasing

**Dungeon Modifiers (Rotating Weekly):**
- **"Gravity's Suggestion":** Fall damage reversed (falling up hurts)
- **"Blibbertooth's Blessing":** Critical hits make enemies explode into confetti (no mechanical change, visual only)
- **"Serious Mode":** No jokes allowed—enemies deal +30% damage if you laugh (tracked via... honor system? Or just a fun tooltip)

---

## V. PROGRESSION & ECONOMY

### **Level Curve & Milestones**

| Level Range | Phase | Key Unlocks |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 1-10 | Awakening | Basic skills, first companion, housing plot |
| 11-30 | Establishment | Mounts, crafting professions, dungeon access |
| 31-60 | Specialization | Advanced combat styles, cosmic skill unlocks, guild joining |
| 61-90 | Mastery | Legendary crafting, Void Walking, endgame dungeons |
| 91-99 | Transcendence | Aether Weaving, world-shaping abilities, raid content |

### **Currency System**

| Currency | Source | Primary Use | F2P/Premium |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Gold** | Combat, selling, trading | Basic gear, consumables, repairs | F2P |
| **Aether Shards** | High-level content, achievements | Epic crafting, housing upgrades, cosmetics | F2P |

- **No direct power purchase**—convenience and speed only

### **The "Next Big Thing" Loop (Retention Design)**

To satisfy your requirement for "semi-constant playable game," Aetheria implements **The Horizon System:**

Every time you log in, the UI highlights 3 things:
1. **The Immediate (0-15 min):** "Your crafting queue finished! You can now upgrade your sword."
2. **The Session (15 min - 2 hours):** "You're 80% to level 45 Mining. New ore vein unlocks at 45."
3. **The Grind (Today/This week):** "Complete 5 dungeons this week for the Celestial Cache reward."

**Milestone Teasers:** Skills show what unlocks at next level, creating "just one more" moments. "Only 3 more logs until level 50 Woodcutting, which unlocks Sentient Oak trees..."

**The "While You Were Away" Report:**
- Combat: "Your Auto-Battle cleared the Whispering Woods 12 times. Gained: 450 Gold, 3 Iron Ore, 1 Uncommon Ring."
- Crafting: "Completed: 45 Iron Bars, 12 Health Potions. Next queue ready."
- Events: "The Fey Market departs in 2 hours! New limited recipe available."

## VI. NARRATIVE SYSTEM

### **Main Storyline: "The Weight of Reality"**

**Act I: The Unraveling Begins (Levels 1-30)**
- Tutorial: You discover you're an Anchor when you survive a local Unraveling that turns your village's sheep into abstract geometry
- Meet the factions, choose initial allegiance (changeable later)
- Discover the first major plot: Someone is *intentionally* causing Unravelings

**Act II: The Cosmic Conspiracy (Levels 31-70)**
- Uncover the **Seriousness Cult**—villains who believe Blibbertooth's accidental creation was a mistake and want to rewrite reality "properly"
- Journey to the Skyward Peaks to consult the Celestial Bureaucracy
- Descend into the Sunken Archives to learn about previous "Anchors" who failed
- The twist: The Seriousness Cult's leader is a previous Anchor who went mad from isolation

**Act III: The Choice (Levels 71-99)**
- You must stabilize the Cosmic Balance, but methods differ:
  - **Luminar Path:** Purify all Voidmire, creating a "perfect" but stagnant world
  - **Voidmire Path:** Embrace chaos, allowing constant change but uncertainty
  - **The Third Option:** Embrace Blibbertooth's philosophy—maintain balance through absurdity and acceptance
- Each path has unique quests, gear, and cosmetic rewards
- All paths lead to stopping the **Total Unraveling** of Valdoria

**Act IV: The Anchor's Burden (Level 100)**
- Post-story content: You become the mentor for new players (future multiplayer feature)
- Unlock **Cosmic Tiers**: Infinite scaling where you "prestige" individual skills for permanent account-wide bonuses
- The true endgame: Discovering that Blibbertooth himself is real, approachable, and offers the ultimate quest: "Make the universe laugh."

### **Side Quest Systems**

**Radiant Quests (Infinite):**
- Procedurally generated based on your current skills and level
- "Gather 20 Void-Touched Ore for the Blacksmith"
- "Clear 3 Unraveling zones in the Whispering Woods"
- Rewards scale with difficulty and always offer meaningful progress

**Character Quests:**
- **Barnaby's Confidence:** Help him overcome self-doubt through 10 quest chain, unlocks his "Certain" form (no self-damage)
- **Lady Mirthless's Secret:** Discover she writes comedy in secret, help her perform at open mic night
- **Archangel File-Not-Found's Promotion:** Help him find his missing paperwork to get promoted to Archangel File-Found

**Seasonal Events:**
- **The Blibbertooth Festival (April):** Practical joke quests, whoopee cushion weapons, comedy club housing items
- **The Celestial Audit (September):** Help the Bureaucracy organize their files for unique orderly-themed cosmetics
- **Voidmas (December):** The Void-Touched celebrate... something. It's ominous but festive. Gift-giving with eldritch wrapping paper.

## VII. MONETIZATION & RETENTION ARCHITECTURE

### **The "Whale" vs "Minnow" Balance**

Based on 2024 idle game success data , Aetheria focuses on **contextual monetization** rather than paywalls:

**Free Player Experience:**
- Full access to all skills and story content
- 8-hour offline progression caps
- Standard inventory space (manageable but tight)
- All gear obtainable through gameplay

**Premium Advantages (Convenience, Not Power):**
- 12-hour offline caps (sleep through the night without loss)
- More bank space (hoarding comfort)
- Faster progression (20% bonus—significant over time but not instant)
- Cosmetics (no stat advantage)

**The "Fading Pendulum" Prevention :**
When players hit progression walls:
1. **Immediate Alternative:** "Can't beat this dungeon? Your crafting queue finished—upgrade your gear!"
2. **Event Pivot:** "The Fey Market is here! Different progression track with unique rewards."
3. **Skill Crossover:** "Stuck in combat? Your Fishing just hit a milestone—new bait type unlocked."

### **The Lumina Shop (Premium Currency)**

| Item | Lumina Cost | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Cosmetic Outfit** | 500-2000 | Visual only, themed monthly |
| **Bank Expansion** | 300 (increasing) | +10 slots each purchase |
| **Skill Boost (24h)** | 200 | +50% XP one skill |
| **Instant Craft** | 50-500 | Skip timer based on duration |
| **Cosmic Rift Key** | 100 | Enter special dungeon (good loot, not exclusive) |
| **Character Slot** | 1000 | Alt characters for different builds |
| **Housing Theme Pack** | 800-1500 | Furniture and layout blueprints |

**The "Treasure Hunt" Battle Pass :**
- Monthly grid system (like Gold & Goblins)
- Free track: Resources, cosmetics, convenience items
- Premium track ($4.99 or 800 Lumina): Exclusive cosmetics, more resources, unique companion skins
- **Key mechanic:** You see the rewards on the grid but must "dig" with daily shovels to unlock them—creates FOMO without paywalling power

### **Retention Mechanics**

**Daily Engagement Loop:**
- **Login Bonus:** Escalating 7-day cycle (day 7 gives Cosmic Essence)
- **Daily Quests:** 3 tasks, 10 minutes to complete, reward Lumina (F2P can earn premium currency slowly)
- **Timed Events:** "The Unraveling spreads in 4 hours!"—scheduled world events that encourage check-ins

**Weekly Long-Term Goals:**
- **Guild Contributions:** (Future) Shared progress bars for server-wide rewards
- **Raid Lockouts:** Weekly high-end content for best gear
- **Leaderboards:** Dungeon clear times, skill levels, collection completion

**The "Always Something" Design:**
Every skill has overlapping timers:
- Mining: 30 seconds per action (active) or 5 minutes (idle)
- Crafting: 2 minutes to 8 hours based on complexity
- Combat: 30 seconds per enemy (active) or 10 minutes (idle dungeon clear)
- Farming (Housing): 4-hour growth cycles

**Result:** No matter when you log in, something is ready to harvest, craft, or complete.

---

## VIII. TECHNICAL & FUTURE-PROOFING

### **Offline Progression Calculation**

When player reconnects:
1. Calculate time elapsed (max 8 hours F2P, 12 Premium)
2. Simulate combat based on last active loadout vs. selected area
3. Process crafting queue (paused if resources depleted)
4. Generate "While You Were Away" report
5. Apply any missed daily bonuses (if within 24 hours)

**Anti-Cheat:** Server-authoritative; client sends "I was fighting X for Y hours" and server validates based on player stats vs. area difficulty.

### **Future Expansion Hooks**

**Year 1 Post-Launch:**
- **Guild System:** Shared housing, guild skills, cooperative raids
- **PvP Arena:** Asynchronous "defense teams" attacking each other (AI controlled)
- **New Region:** The Shimmering Sea (naval combat, underwater skills)

**Year 2:**
- **Second Kingdom:** Cross-server travel to different biomes
- **Player Economy:** Auction house, player shops
- **The Cosmic Plane:** Endgame dimension with roguelike elements

**Technical Debt Prevention:**
- Modular skill system—new skills can be added without rebalancing all
- Horizontal progression at cap—new content adds options, not just numbers
- Seasonal resets for competitive content (leaderboards) but never for character progress

---

## IX. THE "SECRET SAUCE" DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### **What Makes Aetheria Different?**

1. **The Comedy-Cosmic Tone:** Most idle games are serious fantasy or pure comedy. Aetheria treats absurdity as a cosmic force—players save reality by accepting that existence is inherently ridiculous.

2. **The Anchor Identity:** You're not a chosen hero; you're a cosmic accident with a job to do. This justifies both the idle mechanics (you're so heavy you just... stay places) and the progression (you're literally becoming more grounded).

3. **The "Blibbertooth Factor":** Random blessings and curses that are mechanically interesting:
   - "Blessing of the Sneeze": 5% chance any action creates a duplicate resource (cosmic accident)
   - "Curse of Seriousness": 24-hour debuff where all numbers are rounded to nearest 10 (visually upsetting, mechanically neutral)

4. **Crossover Economy:** Unlike Melvor's modular skills, Aetheria forces interaction:
   - To craft a sword, you need Mining (ore), Smithing (refining), Woodcutting (handle), and maybe Cleansing (if ore was cursed)
   - This creates "accidental" progression—you log in to craft, realize you need to mine, start mining, realize your pickaxe broke, start smithing...

5. **The "Just One More" UI:** Every screen shows three things:
   - What you just accomplished (dopamine hit)
   - What you can do right now (engagement)
   - What's coming soon (retention)

---

---

## CONCLUSION

Aetheria: The Idle Chronicles is designed to be the game players think about during their day—not through addictive dark patterns, but through **meaningful overlapping progression systems** that respect both their time and engagement. The cosmic comedy tone differentiates it in a market of serious fantasy idle games, while the robust skill interdependence creates the "Runescape-like" satisfaction of planning and executing long-term goals.

The monetization model prioritizes long-term retention over short-term extraction, recognizing that in free-to-play idle games, a player who stays for 6 months is worth more than one who burns out in 2 weeks . By ensuring there's always a "next big thing"—whether that's a crafting project finishing, a skill milestone approaching, or a seasonal event beginning—Aetheria aims to become a permanent fixture in players' daily routines.

**The ultimate goal:** Create a world players miss when they're away, not because of FOMO mechanics, but because they genuinely enjoy their next login.
