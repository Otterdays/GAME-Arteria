# Skills Architecture — Farming, Agility, Thieving, Crafting

> **Purpose:** Pre-implementation design for four upcoming skills. Fill in content details before coding.
> **Status:** Architecting. Use `ComingSoonBadge` (red = planned, green = in progress) on UI.
> **Last updated:** 2026-03-07
> **Farming:** ✅ Implemented (v0.6.0). See `apps/mobile/constants/farming.ts`, `app/skills/farming.tsx`.
> **Firemaking:** ✅ Implemented (v0.6.0). See `apps/mobile/constants/firemaking.ts`, `app/skills/firemaking.tsx`. 9 burn types (Normal Log → Cosmic Wood); mastery (xp, speed, log saver).
> **Woodworking:** ✅ Implemented (v0.6.0). See `apps/mobile/constants/woodworking.ts`, `app/skills/woodworking.tsx`. 5 recipes (Furniture, Combat, Utility); flagship workbench UI (SkillHeroHeader, SkillCategoryRail, RecipeWorkbenchCard, StickyTaskDock).

## 0. Skill Workbench UI Direction (v0.6.0)

Woodworking introduces a **next-gen artisan screen paradigm** that should guide future skill UI updates. This "workbench" model replaces the plain card-list pattern with a more immersive, touch-friendly layout.

### 0.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Active-task storytelling** | Hero panel prominently shows current recipe, XP/hour, and progress — the player always knows what they're doing. |
| **Input/output clarity** | Recipe cards display explicit input slots and output preview; materials are not buried in text. |
| **One-tap affordance** | Player can instantly see whether they can craft (level gate, affordability count). |
| **Sticky primary action** | Craft/Stop CTA stays visible at bottom; the most important control never scrolls away. |
| **Category scanning** | Segmented chips (e.g. Furniture, Combat, Utility) enable faster browsing than a flat list. |

### 0.2 Reusable Components

Located in `apps/mobile/components/skill/`:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `SkillHeroHeader` | Skill title, level, XP bar, active recipe name, XP/hour. Large progress focus area. |
| `SkillCategoryRail` | Horizontal chips for category filtering (Furniture, Combat, Utility, etc.). |
| `RecipeWorkbenchCard` | Bigger cards with input slots, output preview, level gate, affordability, Craft/Stop. |
| `StickyTaskDock` | Sticky bottom CTA; summary of materials missing or batches available. |

### 0.3 Migration Path

- **Woodworking** is the flagship; it uses all four primitives.
- **Crafting, Firemaking, Herblore** (and future artisan skills) can migrate to this pattern for consistency and premium feel.
- The component API is generic: pass `recipes`, `categories`, `skillId`, and inventory/level data. See `woodworking.tsx` for the reference implementation.

### 0.4 Architecture Flow

```
SkillsTab → WoodworkingScreen → HeroPanel + CategoryRail + RecipeWorkbenchList
RecipeWorkbenchCard → StickyTaskDock → useRequestStartTask → useGameLoop → gameSlice
```

## 1. Farming

### 1.1 Overview

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| **Pillar** | Support (feeds Herblore, Cooking, economy) |
| **Core loop** | Plant seeds → wait (growth timer) → harvest crops |
| **Outputs** | Same herbs/crops as Harvesting (wheat, cabbage, tomato, etc.) — Farming is *cultivated* source; Harvesting is *wild* source |

### 1.2 Patches

| Option | Content details |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Patch count** | 3–5 fixed patches (e.g. Crownlands Farm, Frostvale Greenhouse) |
| **Patch types** | All-purpose (any crop) or crop-specific (wheat-only, herb-only) |
| **Location** | Per-patch: `locationId` from `constants/locations.ts` — Crownlands, Frostvale, etc. |

### 1.3 Seeds & Growth

| Option | Content details |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Seed items** | `wheat_seed`, `cabbage_seed`, `tomato_seed`, … — buy from Nick or drops |
| **Growth stages** | 3–5 stages (planted → growing → ready). Real-time or in-game ticks? |
| **Duration** | Per crop: e.g. wheat 5 min, void_cap 30 min. Config: `growthTicks` or `growthMs` |
| **Harvest** | Same as Harvesting skill? **No** — Farming has its own XP curve; harvest grants Farming XP + items |

### 1.4 Data Structures (draft)

```ts
interface FarmingPatch {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  locationId: string;
  levelReq: number;
  cropType?: 'all' | 'herb' | 'grain'; // optional restriction
}

interface FarmingCrop {
  id: string;
  seedId: string;
  outputId: string;
  outputQty: number;
  levelReq: number;
  growthMs: number; // or growthTicks
  xpPerHarvest: number;
  emoji: string;
}
```

### 1.5 Integration

- **Bank filter:** Add "Seeds" or fold into "Other"
- **Stats:** "Crops harvested"
- **Daily quests:** "Harvest X wheat", "Plant Y seeds"
- **Mastery:** xp_bonus, yield_bonus (more crops per harvest), speed_bonus (faster growth)

---

## 2. Agility

### 2.1 Overview

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| **Pillar** | Support |
| **Core loop** | Run courses (obstacle laps) — XP only, no items |
| **Unlocks** | Shortcuts (travel), passive bonuses (e.g. +1% global speed per course tier) |

### 2.2 Courses

| Option | Content details |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Structure** | Same as gathering nodes: `id`, `name`, `levelReq`, `xpPerTick`, `baseTickMs`, `successRate` |
| **No items** | Courses produce XP only; no consumedItems, no items array |
| **Count** | 6–8 courses from low (Crownlands Rooftops) to high (Void Rift) |

### 2.3 Course List (draft)

| id | name | levelReq | xpPerTick | baseTickMs | successRate |
|----|------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| crownlands_rooftops | Crownlands Rooftops | 1 | 8 | 4000 | 1 |
| forest_stumps | Forest Stump Run | 10 | 18 | 4500 | 0.95 |
| docks_balance | Docks Balance Beam | 25 | 35 | 5000 | 0.9 |
| fey_ring | Fey Ring Leap | 45 | 60 | 6000 | 0.85 |
| scorched_ledge | Scorched Ledge | 65 | 95 | 7000 | 0.8 |
| void_rift | Void Rift Traverse | 85 | 140 | 8500 | 0.7 |

### 2.4 Unlocks (Phase 2)

- **Shortcuts:** Reduce travel time between locations (e.g. Crownlands → Forest)
- **Passive:** +0.5% global action speed per course mastered (max 3%)

### 2.5 Integration

- **Bank:** No new filters (no items)
- **Stats:** "Laps completed" or "Agility XP"
- **Daily quests:** "Complete X laps at Crownlands Rooftops"
- **Mastery:** xp_bonus, speed_bonus (faster laps)

## 3. Thieving

### 3.1 Overview

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| **Pillar** | Gathering (alternative economy) |
| **Core loop** | Pickpocket NPCs or loot stalls → gold, items, chance of failure/stun |
| **Risk** | Success rate < 1; failure = no loot, possible stun (skip N ticks) |

### 3.2 Targets

| Option | Content details |
|--------|-----------------|
| **NPCs** | Pickpocket: Guard, Nick, Bianca, Kate — each has `levelReq`, `successRate`, `lootTable` |
| **Stalls** | Loot stalls (e.g. Fruit Stall, Silk Stall) — same structure as nodes |
| **Loot** | Gold + chance of item (e.g. fruit, silk, rune essence) |

### 3.3 Data Structures (draft)

```ts
interface ThievingTarget {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'pickpocket' | 'stall';
  levelReq: number;
  xpPerTick: number;
  baseTickMs: number;
  successRate: number;
  lootGold: { min: number; max: number };
  lootItems?: { id: string; quantity: number; chance: number }[];
  emoji: string;
}
```

### 3.4 Failure / Stun

- **On fail:** No XP, no loot. Optional: `stunTicks` (e.g. 3 ticks = 12s) — task auto-pauses
- **Detection:** Roll `successRate` per tick; on fail, dispatch `thieving_fail` toast + optional stun

### 3.5 Integration

- **Bank filter:** "Stolen" or fold into existing (gold from thieving goes to player.gold)
- **Stats:** "Pickpockets", "Stalls looted"
- **Daily quests:** "Pickpocket X from Guard", "Loot Y fruit"
- **Mastery:** xp_bonus, yield_bonus (more gold/items), speed_bonus

---

## 5. Implementation Order (Suggested)

| Order | Skill | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Agility** | Simplest — XP-only courses, no new items, no growth timers |
| 2 | **Thieving** | Adds risk/reward, reuses NPCs, new loot tables |
| 3 | **Crafting** | Cross-skill recipes, new item types, feeds combat (arrows) |
| 4 | **Farming** | Most complex — patches, seeds, growth timers, new subsystem |

---

## 6. ComingSoonBadge Usage

Use the shared `ComingSoonBadge` component:

- **`inProgress={true}`** → Green badge: "In progress"
- **`inProgress={false}`** → Red badge: "Coming soon"

Wire to: Skills grid (unimplemented skills), Location screens (NPCs/Shop/Quests stubs), Explore (locked locations), Combat (Phase 4 teaser).

## 14. Skill Cape System (Level 99 Mastery)

### 14.1 Overview
| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| **Requirement** | Reach Level 99 (Max Level) in any given skill. |
| **Pillar** | Endgame / Prestige / Equipment |
| **Core Loop** | Max a skill → Visit the "Master of Masters" NPC (or specialized NPCs) → Purchase Skill Cape for 99,000 Gold. |
| **Benefit** | Equippable item (requires adding a `cape` or `back` EquipSlot) that provides best-in-slot defensive stats and a unique passive modifier tied to that specific skill. |

### 14.2 Vendor Details
- **NPC Name:** The Ascended Master (or "Master Lin").
- **Location:** A high-level hub area, e.g., The Skyward Peaks or a hidden guild in the Crownlands.
- **Shop Mechanic:** The shop's inventory dynamically populates with the skill capes the player is eligible for (checking `player.skills[skillId].level >= 99`).
- **Cost:** 99,000 Gold per cape.

### 14.3 Equipment Mechanics
- **New Equip Slot:** Expand `EquipSlot` in `constants/items.ts` to include `'cape'`.
- **Base Stats (All Capes):** Excellent all-around defenses (e.g., `meleeDefence: 15, rangedDefence: 15, magicDefence: 15`).
- **Passive Perks:** Equipping a cape grants a specialized mastery buff. 

### 14.4 Example Capes & Perks (Draft)
| Cape Name | Skill | Unique Passive Perk |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Cape of the Depths | Mining | +5% double-ore chance (stacks with Mastery). |
| Cape of the Canopy | Logging | +10% chance to not deplete a tree upon a successful chop. |
| Cape of the Anvil | Forging | +15% chance to forge an item without consuming bars. |
| Cape of the Void | Runecrafting | 10% chance to craft a Void Rune alongside any standard rune combination. |
| Cape of the Harvest | Harvesting | Auto-replants seeds for free if you own them in inventory. |

### 14.5 Emote System (Phase 2 Add-on)
- Clicking a dedicated "Emote" button while a Skill Cape is equipped plays a unique visual animation/effect on the UI (e.g., Anvil hammering spark for Forging, swirling stars for Astrology) and pushes a server-wide or local activity log message: *"The player flexes their mastery of [Skill]!"*
