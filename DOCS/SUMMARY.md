# SUMMARY

**Project:** Untitled Mobile AFK RPG (Melvor Idle Style)
**Platform:** Modern Android (React Native via Expo)
**Timeline Base:** Up to February 25, 2026

**Overview:**
A math-heavy, passive progression RPG without real-time action gameplay. The core loops rely heavily on state management, background calculation offline progress, and optimizing "Ticks" for skills and combat.

**Current Status:**
- Planning phase initiated.
- Defined tech stack and architecture based on modern Expo, React Native, and Tamagui monorepo rules.
- Establishing baseline documentation.

**Next Steps:**
- Initialize Expo Monorepo.
- Setup Redux Toolkit (RTK) / Zustand for complex offline math states.
- Setup Tamagui for clean, dark-mode native UI.
