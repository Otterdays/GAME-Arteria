## What is Arteria?

A math-heavy, incremental idle RPG inspired by **Melvor Idle** and **RuneScape**. Built on **React Native (Expo)** with **Redux Toolkit** for state and a modular engine you can run headless or in the app.

- **25 skills** across 5 pillars (Gathering, Crafting, Combat, Support, Cosmic)
- **Offline progression** with a 24h cap (F2P-friendly)
- **Pure TypeScript engine** — no React in the core; unit-tested with Jest
- **Expo SDK 55** + Expo Router, MMKV persistence, 100ms game loop
